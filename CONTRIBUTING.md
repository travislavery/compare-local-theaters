#Contributing
Feel free to contribute! To add another theater you will, unfortunately, need to create a scraper for that website. I do plan to combine both scapers into a single class eventually, but for the time being just mimic them with the nokogiri specifications of that theater's website.

Additionally, if you find any bugs I'd love to hear about them to hopefully get them patched. Bug and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/travislavery/compare-local-theaters.git.
